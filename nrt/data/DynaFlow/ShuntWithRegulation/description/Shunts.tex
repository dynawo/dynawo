\chapter{Shunt with sections.}

The following system is simulated. It is made of a generator (GeneratorPVSignalN), two transformers, three lines, a restorative alpha beta load (LoadAlphaBetaRestorative) and a shunt with sections (ShuntBWithSectionsWithRegulation) connected at the load bus.\\

The shunt, is modeled as a susceptance B that can be changed when the section of the shunt is changed (the values are given in a table that gives B depending on the section of the shunt).\\

In this test case, the section of the shunt is controlled depending on the voltage measure at the load bus.\\

At t=30s, the line is disconnected.\\

As a consequence, the voltage at the load terminal decreases. The section of the shunt then increases, so that its susceptance increases, which helps the voltage to go back to its reference value (with a deadband).
