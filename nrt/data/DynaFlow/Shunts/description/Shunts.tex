\chapter{Shunt with sections.}

The following system is simulated. It is made of a generator (GeneratorPVSignalN), two transformers, three lines, a restorative alpha beta load (LoadAlphaBetaRestorative) and a shunt with sections (ShuntBWithSections) connected at the load bus.\\

The shunt, is modeled as a susceptance B that can be changed when the section of the shunt is changed (the values are given in a table that gives B depending on the section of the shunt).\\

At t=50s, the section of the shunt is changed, from 0 to 1. As a consequence, B increases, which increases the reactive power generation of the shunt and thus decreases the reactive power generation of the generator.\\
