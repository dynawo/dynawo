\chapter{IEEE14 with Automata}

This document presents the different tests conducted on the IEEE 14-bus test case with the different automaton models that can be found in the \Dynawo library.\\

Here is the IEEE 14-bus system topology:

\end{figure}

The description of the data, models and other characteristics of the test case can be found in the IEEE14\_BasicTestSystems description directory. \\

For each test presented in this document, one or more automata have been added to the initial IEEE 14-bus test system introduced in the aforementioned description. All the modifications that have been made on this initial test case are listed and justified in the coming sections dedicated to the each automaton.\\

The tested automaton are;
\begin{itemize}
\item the under-voltage automaton [\ref{UnderVoltageAutomaton}];
\item the phase-shifter I automaton [\ref{PhaseShifterIAutomaton}];
\item the phase-shifter P automaton [\ref{PhaseShifterPAutomaton}];
\item the current limit automaton [\ref{CurrentLimitAutomaton}];

\section{Under voltage automaton}
\label{UnderVoltageAutomaton}

The under voltage automaton disconnects a generator from the grid if its voltage is under a certain threshold for a certain amount of time.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

Initial conditions are the same that in the IEEE 14-bus basic test cases.

\subsection{Models}

An under voltage automaton is added on the generator number 3. The role of the automaton is to disconnect the generator if its voltage drops too much. The generators regulations are removed for this test in order to simulate a deep voltage drop that can activate the under voltage automaton.\\

The under voltage automaton measures the generator voltage (in this test at its network connection point) and sends the disconnection order when the voltage has spent more than $t_{Action}$ seconds under $U_{Min}$.\\

The under voltage automaton parameters are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
   $U_{Min_{Pu}}=0.85pu$ & $t_{Action}=5s$  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Scenario}
At $t=20s$, the following load variations are simulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the active and reactive power of load 2 are changed from $P=21.7MW$ and $Q=12.7Mvar$ to $P=100MW$ and $Q=200Mvar$}
\item{the active and reactive power of load 3 are changed from $P=94.2MW$ and $Q=19Mvar$ to $P=200MW$ and $Q=200Mvar$}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solver}
The solver used is the variable time step solver IDA with the following parameters:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $Order$=2 & $Accuracy_{Rel}$=10e-4 & $Accuracy_{Abs}$=10e-4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\newpage
\subsection{Results}

The simulated load variations make the network voltage decrease at node 3, until achieving the minimum threshold of the automaton. The generator is disconnected 5 seconds later, which corresponds to the action time.\\

\section{Phase Shifter I}
\label{PhaseShifterIAutomaton}

The phase-shifter I is an automaton that gradually changes the tap of a phase-shifter transformer if its monitored transiting current goes higher than a defined threshold for a certain amount of time.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

Initial conditions are the same that in the IEEE 14-bus basic test cases.

\subsection{Models}

Instead of a ratio tap changer transformer (no phase shift) between buses 5 and 6, we use a phase tap changer transformer controlled by a phase-shifter I automaton in order to regulate the transiting current.
The automaton is supposed to keep the transit under a given threshold, by reducing or increasing the phase shift step by step. \\

The phase-shifter I measures the current flowing through a transformer and sends an order to change its tap if the monitored transiting current stays higher than $I_{Max}$ for a certain amount of time. Then the automaton keeps on making the transformer change its tap until its current reaches $I_{Stop}$. The first tap is changed after a delay $t_{1st}$ and the next taps are changed after $t_{Next}$ seconds. \\

The phase-shifter parameters are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $I_{Max}=0.475pu$ & $t_{1st}=10s$ & $tap_{Max}=13$ \\
   $I_{Stop}=0.45pu$  & $t_{Next}=5s$ & $tap_{Min}=1$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Scenario}
At $t=20s$, the following line disconnection is simulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the line connecting bus 9 to bus 10 is opened at its bus 10 end}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solver}
The solver used is the variable time step solver IDA with the following parameters:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $Order$=2 & $Accuracy_{Rel}$=10e-4 & $Accuracy_{Abs}$=10e-4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\newpage
\subsection{Results}

At t=20s, the line is disconnected. Following the topology modification, the current through the transformer monitored by the phase shifter I becomes higher than its threshold $I_{Max}$. After a time delay of 10s, the phase shifter changes its first step, which results in a step decrease of the transformer's current. Then, step are changed every 5s and the process repeats until the current reaches $I_{Stop}$ and don't cross $I_{Max}$ again. \\

\section{Phase Shifter P}
\label{PhaseShifterPAutomaton}

The phase-shifter P is an automaton that gradually changes the tap of a phase-shifter transformer if its monitored transiting active power goes out of a certain range for a certain amount of time.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

Initial conditions are the same that in the IEEE 14-bus basic test cases.

\subsection{Models}

Instead of a ratio tap changer transformer (no phase shift) between buses 5 and 6, we use a phase tap changer transformer controlled by a phase-shifter P automaton in order to regulate the transiting active power.
The automaton is supposed to keep the transit within acceptable bounds, by reducing or increasing the phase shift step by step. \\

The phase-shifter P measures the transiting active power through a transformer and sends an order to change the its tap if the monitored active power differs from $P_{target}$ by more than $P_{DeadBand}$. The first tap is changed after the time $t_{1st}$ and the next taps are changed after $t_{Next}$ seconds.\\

The phase-shifter parameters are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $P_{target}=0.44pu$ & $t_{1st}=10s$ & $tap_{Max}=13$ \\
   $P_{DeadBand}=0.005pu$  & $t_{Next}=5s$ & $tap_{Min}=1$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Scenario}
At $t=20s$, the following line disconnection is simulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the line connecting bus 9 to bus 10 is opened at its bus 10 end}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solver}
The solver used is the variable time step solver IDA with the following parameters:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $Order$=2 & $Accuracy_{Rel}$=10e-4 & $Accuracy_{Abs}$=10e-4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\newpage
\subsection{Results}

At t=20s, the line is disconnected. Following the topology modification, the current through the transformer monitored by the phase shifter goes out of the tolerated range around $P_{Target}$.  10 seconds later, the transformer tap is changed which results in a step decrease of transiting active power. Though, it is still not in the tolerated range so the phase-shifter increases the tap again, this time only waiting for 5 seconds. Consequently, the active power transit drops and transiently falls back into the dead-band before going out of it again. Therefore, the phase-shifter P first temporarily stops taking steps, and then starts again waiting for a 10s delay before shifting to the next tap. This process repeats two times more and the automaton stops acting once the active power transit finally stabilizes in the range around $P_{Target}$. \\

\section{Current limit automaton}
\label{CurrentLimitAutomaton}

The current limit automaton monitors a line's transiting current and opens it if it is superior to a defined threshold for a certain amount of time.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

Initial conditions are the same that in the IEEE 14-bus basic test cases.

\subsection{Models}

Two current limit automata are added to the network : one monitoring the line connecting bus 2 to bus 4, one monitoring the line connecting bus 2 to bus 5.
Automata's role is to protect their line from unbearable currents by disconnecting it after a too long over-current constraint. \\

The current limit automaton measures the current transiting through a line and sends an order to disconnect it if it stays more than $t_{Action}$ seconds above the threshold $I_{Max}$. The order also specifies the type of disconnection (origin end, extremity end, or both).\\

The current limit automaton monitoring line bus2-bus5 parameters are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $I_{Max}=600A$ & $t_{Action}=5$ & $order=1$ (disconnect both ends)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The current limit automaton monitoring line bus2-bus4 parameters are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $I_{Max}=1000A$ & $t_{Action}=10$ & $order=3$ (disconnect bus 4 end)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Scenario}
At $t=5s$, the following line disconnection is simulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the line connecting bus 1 to bus 5 is opened at its bus 5 end}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solver}
The solver used is the variable time step solver IDA with the following parameters:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $Order$=2 & $Accuracy_{Rel}$=10e-4 & $Accuracy_{Abs}$=10e-4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\newpage
\subsection{Results}

At t=5s, the line 1-5 is disconnected. Following this topology change, the current value on the line 2-5 monitored by the first current limit automaton becomes higher than its threshold $I_{Max}$=600 A. After the time delay (5s), and as the current didn't go back under $I_{Max}$, the automaton then opens line 2-5.
As a consequence, the transit on line 2-4 increases and exceeds the second current limit automaton threshold $I_{Max}$=1000 A . After the time delay (10s), and as the current didn't go back under $I_{Max}$, the automaton opens line 2-4. \\

\section{Tap Changer (Modelica)}
\label{TapChangerAutomatonModelica}

The tap-changer is an automaton that changes the tap of a transformer if its monitored terminal voltage goes out of a certain range for a certain amount of time. In this test, the Modelica model is tested.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

Initial conditions are the same that in the IEEE 14-bus basic test cases.

\subsection{Models}

Load number 3 is moved behind a transformer equipped with a tap-changer. The role of the tap-changer is to maintain the load terminal voltage within a certain range, independently of what happens on the transmission system level. \\

The tap-changer measures the load terminal voltage and sends an order to change the transformer tap if the monitored voltage differs from $U_{target}$ by more than $U_{DeadBand}$. The first tap is changed after the time $t_{1st}$ and the next taps are changed after $t_{Next}$ seconds.\\

The tap-changer parameters are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $U_{Target}=1pu$ & $t_{1st}=60s$ & $tap_{Max}=84$ \\
   $U_{DeadBand}=0.01pu$  & $t_{Next}=10s$ & $tap_{Min}=0$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Scenario}
At $t=20s$, the following load variation is simulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the reactive power of load 3 is changed from $Q=12.7Mvar$ to $Q=30Mvar$}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solver}
The solver used is the variable time step solver IDA with the following parameters:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $Order$=2 & $Accuracy_{Rel}$=10e-4 & $Accuracy_{Abs}$=10e-4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\newpage
\subsection{Results}

The simulated load variation makes the network voltage drop at node 3. The load 3 terminal voltage also decreases until it goes out of the tolerated range around $U_{Target}$. 60 seconds later, the transformer tap is changed which results in a step increase of the load terminal voltage. The voltage is still not in the tolerated range so the tap-changer changes the tap again, this time only waiting for 10 seconds, and stops acting once the load terminal voltage finally reaches the range around $U_{Target}$.

  \end{tikzpicture}
}
\caption{Impact of the transformer tap modification on the network voltage}
\end{figure}

We observe that changing the tap helps restoring the load terminal voltage but has a negative impact on the network voltage: each time the tap is increased, the network voltage is decreased a little. If many transformers are changing taps at the same time and on the same network area it could lead to a general voltage collapse. In order to avoid this phenomena, other automata called "Tap-Changer Blocking" monitor the network voltage and can stop the transformers from changing their taps.


\newpage
\section{Tap Changer (CPP)}
\label{TapChangerAutomatonCpp}

The tap-changer is an automaton that changes the tap of a transformer if its monitored terminal voltage goes out of a certain range for a certain amount of time. In this test, the default C++ model is tested.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

Initial conditions are the same that in the IEEE 14-bus basic test cases.

\subsection{Models}

Transformer 5-6 tap-changer has been activated to control the voltage at the transformer higher terminal (node 5). The role of the tap-changer is to maintain the high terminal voltage within a certain range, independently of what happens on the other terminal. \\

The tap-changer measures the high terminal voltage and sends an order to change the transformer tap if the monitored voltage differs from $targetV$ by more than $tolV$. The first tap is changed after the time $t1st_{HT}$ and the next taps are changed after $tNext_{HT}$ seconds.\\

The tap-changer parameters are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
   $targetV=1pu$ & $t1st_{HT}=60s$ \\
   $tolV=0.01pu$  & $tNext_{HT}=10s$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note: As we use the default C++ ratio tap-changer model, no information is added in the .dyd file, but rather in the .iidm file. The sequence "terminalRef" should be added with the attributes $id$ and $side$, and the target voltage $targetV$ should be given as attribute of the "ratioTapChanger". All the other parameters are given in the .par file, in the network parameters set.

\subsection{Scenario}
At $t=20s$, the following load variation is simulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the reactive power of load 5 is changed from $Q=1.6Mvar$ to $Q=84Mvar$}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solver}
The solver used is the variable time step solver IDA with the following parameters:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $Order$=2 & $Accuracy_{Rel}$=10e-4 & $Accuracy_{Abs}$=10e-4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Results}

The simulated load variation makes the network voltage drop at node 5, going out of the tolerated range around $targetV$. 60 seconds later, the transformer tap is changed which results in a step increase of the node 5 voltage. The voltage is still not in the tolerated range so the tap-changer changes the tap again, this time only waiting for 10 seconds, and stops acting once the voltage finally reaches the range around $targetV$.

\section{Tap Changer Blocking}
\label{TapChangerBlockingAutomaton}

The tap-changer lock automaton is an automaton that can prevent the tap-changers of a given area to change the tap of their transformers if the area monitored voltage  goes under a certain threshold for a certain amount of time. This automaton should prevent the network to experience voltage collapses.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

Initial conditions are the same that in the IEEE 14-bus basic test cases.

\subsection{Models}

Load number 2 and 3 are moved behind a transformer equipped with a tap-changer. A tap-changer lock automaton which observes the voltage at the bus number 3 is added to the test case. It can lock the tap-changers of the aforementioned loads. \\

The tap-changer lock automaton activates a lock order if the monitored voltage goes under $U_{Min}$ for $t_{BeforeLocked}$ seconds. The lock order is then send to the tap-changer in $t_{TransLockedT}$ seconds for a load behind one transformer. For a load behind two transformers this time lag $t_{TransLockedT}$ corresponds to the sending time of the order to the transmission transformer and $t_{TransLockedD}$ corresponds to the sending time of the order to the distribution transformer. \\

The tap-changer lock automaton parameters are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
   $U_{Min}=0.9824pu$ & $t_{TransLockedT}=10s$ \\
   $t_{BeforeLocked}=20s$  & $t_{TransLockedD}=10s$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Scenario}
At $t=20s$, the following load variations are simulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the reactive power of load 2 is changed from $Q=12.08Mvar$ to $Q=200Mvar$}
\item{the reactive power of load 3 is changed from $Q=12.7Mvar$ to $Q=200Mvar$}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solver}
The solver used is the variable time step solver IDA with the following parameters:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $Order$=2 & $Accuracy_{Rel}$=10e-4 & $Accuracy_{Abs}$=10e-4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Results}

The simulated load variations make the network voltage drop at node 2 and 3 (monitored by the tap-changer lock automaton), as well as the load terminal voltages (monitored by the loads transformers tap-changers). From $t=80s$ to $t=120s$, the load 2 and 3 tap-changers change the transformers taps to restore the voltage at the load terminal, which damages the network voltage.

At $t=100s$,the tap-changer lock automaton monitored voltage crosses $U_{Min}$ permanently. The lock order of the tap-changer blocking automaton is activated 20 seconds after that, and received by the load transformer 10 seconds later. The load transformers then stop to change taps and the network voltage stops decreasing.

\end{figure}

If we try to simulate this test case without the tap-changer blocking automaton we see that the transformers of load 2 and 3 keep changing taps and that the voltages of the area keep decreasing. In order to run this scenario, two possibilities are available: delete the tap-changer lock automaton in the .dyd file (with its connections), or set the automaton threshold $UMin=0$ in the .par file (that way the automaton will never get activated).
