\chapter{IEEE14 with Automata}

This document presents the different tests conducted on the IEEE 14-bus test case with the different automaton models that can be found in the Dynawo library.\\

Here is the IEEE 14-bus system topology:

  \caption{IEEE 14 bus system diagram}
\end{figure}

The description of the data, models and other characteristics of the test case can be found in the IEEE14\_BasicTestSystems description directory. \\

For each test presented in this document, one or more automata have been added to the initial IEEE 14-bus test system introduced in the aforementioned description. All the modifications that have been made on this initial test case are listed and justified in the coming sections dedicated to the each automaton.\\

The tested automaton are;
\begin{itemize}
\item the under-voltage automaton [\ref{UnderVoltageAutomaton}];
\end{itemize}

\section{Under voltage automaton}
\label{UnderVoltageAutomaton}

The under voltage automaton disconnects a generator from the grid if its voltage is under a certain threshold for a certain amount of time.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

Initial conditions are the same that in the IEEE 14-bus basic test cases.

\subsection{Models}

An under voltage automaton is added on the generator number 3. The role of the automaton is to disconnect the generator if its voltage drops too much. The generators regulations are removed for this test in order to simulate a deep voltage drop that can activate the under voltage automaton.\\

The under voltage automaton measures the generator voltage (in this test at its network connection point) within the time $t_{Measure}$ and sends the disconnection order when the voltage has spent more than $t_{Action}$ seconds under $U_{Min}$.\\

The under voltage automaton parameters are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
   $U_{Min_{Pu}}=0.85p.u$ & $t_{Measure}=2s$  \\
    & $t_{Action}=3s$   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Scenario}
At $t=20s$, the following load variations are simulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the active and reactive power of load 2 are changed from $P=21.7MW$ and $Q=12.7MVar$ to $P=100MW$ and $Q=200MVar$}
\item{the active and reactive power of load 3 are changed from $P=94.2MW$ and $Q=19MVar$ to $P=200MW$ and $Q=200MVar$}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solver}
The solver used is the variable time step solver IDA with the following parameters:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
   $Order$=2 & $Accuracy_{Rel}$=10e-4 & $Accuracy_{Abs}$=10e-4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\newpage
\section{Results}

The simulated load variations make the network voltage decrease at node 3, until achieving the minimum threshold of the automaton. 5 seconds later, the generator is disconnected, which corresponds to the addition of the measurement time and the action time.\\
