    Documentation(info = "<html><head></head><body><p>This section contains the naming and style guidelines for the Dynawo library development. If you want to contribute to the library, please make sure you follow them strictly, to ensure a consistent style throughout the whole library.</p>

<p>When writing a Modelica model, please respect the general <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.UsersGuide.Conventions\">Modelica conventions</a> and follow the recommendations below.</p>

<p>Please always use the English language for the code and comments.</p>

<h2>Electrical conventions</h2>

<p>For currents and powers, the <strong>receptor convention</strong> is normally followed, i.e. the value is positive when entering the device. It is recommended to draw a small scheme indicating the conventions.</p>

<p> The name of the electrical connector should be <strong>terminal</strong> for an injector type model, and <strong>terminal1 and terminal2</strong> for a branch type model. </p>

<h2>Package structure conventions</h2>

<p> Each dynamic model should have a .mo file. These models can extend base models. All base models should be gathered in a specific base package. </p>

<p> Each init model should have a .mo file. These models can extend base models that should be gathered in a specific base package. </p>

<p> In package.order, the package containing the base models should be indicated first, followed by each pair of initialization and dynamic model. </p>

<h2>Naming conventions</h2>

<h3>Generalities</h3>

<p>Use package namespaces as much as possible to avoid naming conflicts. Do not duplicate parent namespaces in the children model names.</p>

<p>Please follow the <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.UsersGuide.Conventions.ModelicaCode.Naming\">Modelica naming conventions</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Package/Class/Model</strong> : start with upper case letter and use camel-case convention, e.g \"ElectricCurrent\" </li>
<li>
<strong>Parameters/Constants</strong>: start with an upper case letter</li>
<li>
<strong>Variables/Connectors/Component</strong> instance : start with lower case letter and use camel-case convention</li>
<li>
<strong>Functions</strong>: start with lower case letter</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to this, please follow the additional naming conventions bellow:</p>

<ul dir=\"auto\">
<li>
<strong>Start</strong> parameters/variables: end with <code>Start</code></li>
<li>
<strong>Per-unit</strong> parameters/variables: end with <code>Pu</code></li>
<li>
<strong>Min/Max</strong> parameters/variables: end with <code>Min/Max</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>
Exceptions for physical variables</h3>

<p>There are some exceptions for the physical variables. Please refer to the list below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Frequencies</strong> should be named f. A parameter related to a frequency should start with a lower case letter, e.g fACNetwork.</li>
<li>
<strong>Currents</strong> should be named <code>i</code> (for complex variable) or <code>I</code> (for absolute value)</li>
<li>
<strong>Voltages (phase-to-phase)</strong> should be named <code>u</code> (for complex variable) or <code>U</code> (for absolute value)</li>
<li>
<strong>Voltages (phase-to-ground)</strong> should be named <code>v</code> (for complex variable) or <code>V</code> (for absolute value)</li>
<li>
<strong>Apparent power</strong> should be named s (for complex variable) or S (for absolute value)</li>
<li>
<strong>Active power</strong> should be named P, <strong>reactive power</strong> should be named Q</li>
<li>
<strong>Impedance</strong> should be named <code>Z</code>, <strong>resistance</strong> should be named <code>R</code>, <strong>reactance</strong> should be named <code>X</code>,
</li><strong>Admittance</strong> should be named <code>Y</code>, <strong>conductance</strong> should be named <code>G</code>, <strong>susceptance</strong> should be named <code>B</code>
<li>
<strong>Angles</strong> should be named according to their name in textbooks (ex: theta)</li>
<li>
<strong>Time</strong> should be named t (T is used for the temperature).
 A parameter related to a time should start with a lower case letter,
e.g tInteger, t0...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exceptions for initialization models</h3>

<p>Initialization models name should end with <strong>_INIT</strong>. There can be several initialization models for one dynamic model. </p>

<p> The initialization models variables are the parameters of the dynamic models so they should start with an upper case letter. </p>

<h3>Types conventions</h3>

<p dir=\"auto\">Preferably use the types defined in the <a href=\"modelica://Dynawo.Types\">Dynawo.Types</a> package and avoid using plain <code>Real</code> variables.</p>

<h2>Model structure conventions</h2>

<h3>Generalities</h3>

<p>Respect the following order while writing or updating a model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modelica library imports (alphabetical order)</li>
<li>Other libraries imports (alphabetical order)</li>
<li>Internal Dynawo imports (alphabetical order)</li>
<li>extends statements</li>
<li>public items: parameters, connectors (group them based on functional aspects)</li>
<li>protected items: parameters, variables, blocks (group them based on functional aspects)</li>
<li>equations: complex and intermediate variables management equations first, followed by when equations and if equations</li>
<li>annotations: remove minor tool-specific annotations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Public/Protected conventions</h3>

<div><ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong> should be used for external parameters and connectors</li>
<li><strong>Protected</strong> should be used for initial parameters, internal parameters and variables.</li>
</ul></div>

<h3>Comments and documentation conventions</h3>

<p>Comments should start with a capital letter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Always comment <strong>all</strong> models, function, parameters and variables, using the Modelica <code>\"comments\"</code>, explaining concisely but clearly what is their meaning/use. These comments are meant for the library users and automatically show up at various places in the graphical user interface (e.g. in the variables browser to inspect simulation results).</li>
<li>Use <code>//</code> comments for equations and implementation description (base transformation, model conventions). These comments are meant for library developers.</li>
</ul><div>In addition to comments, always fill the documentation part of your model (available in the documentation browser) by explaining what are the hypothesis done in the model and for which simulation the model could be used. If it is relevant, also include graphical views helping to understand the model's behavior. &nbsp;</div>

<h3>Model implementation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use complex numbers (and native associated functions) whenever possible</li>
<li>Use the <i>flow </i>keyword for init complex current declaration (they could be used in initConnect into Dynawo tool)</li>
<li>Use discrete Real for non-continuous variables</li>
<li>Use inner/outer variables for shared general variables</li>
<li>Use input/output keywords for the inputs/ouputs seen from the model (at least for control models)</li>
<li>Component state

<ul>
<li>
<strong>running</strong> describes a state when something is flowing through the device</li>
<li>
<strong>on</strong> describes a state when the device is turned on (but no flow may be flowing through)</li>
<li>
<strong>off</strong> describes a state when the device is shut down (no flow is expected)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Graphical view</h3>

<p> Try to use one of the <a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Icons\"> Modelica icons</a> or <a href=\"modelica://Dynawo.AdditionalIcons\"> Dynawo icons</a> when creating a model.</p>

<h3>Preferred view</h3>

<p> Always set a preferred view to your model such as it will be opened by default in this view by Modelica-based environments:</p><p></p><ul><li>text view for equation-based models</li><li>diagram view for input/output or block models</li><li>info view for documentation</li></ul><p></p></body></html>"));
