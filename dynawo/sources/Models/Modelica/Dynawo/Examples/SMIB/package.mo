It is is a well-known test case in the power system community. It is very often used to illustrate the transient or the small-signal stability of a synchronous machine. It is also used to demonstrate the behavior of a new regulation, such as a speed governor, a voltage regulation or a power-system stabilizer.</body></html>"));
