Each test case has been configured with the best options available in OpenModelica for power sytem simulations.</p><p>Please notice that the models available into the Dynawo library have been developed to be used with the DAE mode into OpenModelica. Unfortunately, there is currently a bug under correction into OpenModelica which prevents us from using the DAE mode into our examples (the link to external C methods is broken): it could either lead to a compilation error with some models (containg when loops with non linear conditions) or affect dramatically the performances. Once this will be corrected, the daeMode option will be uncommented in our test cases.</p></body></html>"));
