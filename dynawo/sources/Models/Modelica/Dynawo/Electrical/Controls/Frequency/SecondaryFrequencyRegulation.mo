    Documentation(info = "<html><head></head><body>This model calculates a signal NSFR to give to the generators participating in the secondary frequency regulation. The generators that participate receive the signal N + NSFR, while the generators that only participate in the primary frequency regulation only receive the signal N. In steady-state, der(NSFR) = N = 0, which means that, after the transient, only the generators that receive NSFR have changed their active power reference setpoint to compensate the active power mismatch. The other generators went back to their initial active power generation. When the secondary frequency regulation is modelled, the signal N behaves like a primary frequency control.</body></html>"));
