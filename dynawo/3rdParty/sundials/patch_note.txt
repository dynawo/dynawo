The patch is divided in 4 parts:

1. IDASetURound
It defines a new method IDASetURound to change the default ida_uround to compare the root functions equality.
By default it is UNIT_ROUNDOFF = DBL_EPSILON = 2.22045e-16

2. KINSetInitialAdditionalTolerance
This method adds a coefficient for the first criteria check of convergence of the first residual in the Newton algorithm.
It aims to be more strict at first iteration: f_norm <= (initialaddtol*fnormtol).
By default 0.1 is used.

3. Modification of g evaluations.
We use a temporary variable (trout, grout) to detect sign change of g.

4. Debug logs to dynawo about ida resolution
