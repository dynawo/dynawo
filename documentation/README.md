# Dyna&omega;o - Documentation

This directory contains LaTeX sources for Dyna&omega;o documentation.

You can download Dyna&omega;o documentation [here](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo/releases/download/v1.2.0/DynawoDocumentation.pdf).

**We will soon provide some guidelines on how to contribute to this documentation.**

Scripts:
* **compile.sh**: compile each separated LaTex document (except the licenses).
* **dynawo_documentation.sh**: merge all LaTex files to create the complete Dyna&omega;o documentation.
* **clean.sh**: remove all latex temporary files and pdf.

For the moment this scripts should be launched from this directory to work properly.
