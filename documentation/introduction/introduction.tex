\section{What is \Dynawo ?}

\textbf{\Dynawo is an hybrid C++/Modelica open source suite of simulation tools for power systems. It aims at providing power system stakeholders with a transparent, flexible, interoperable and robust suite of simulation tools that could ease collaboration and cooperation in the power system community.} \\

To achieve this goal, \textbf{\Dynawo is based on two mains principles}: the use of a high-level modelling language \href{https://modelica.org/} {\underline{Modelica}} and a strict separation between the modelling and the solving parts. \\

It is an ongoing project based on previous works conducted particularly in two R\&D European projects: \href{http://www.fp7-pegase.com/}{\underline{Pegase}} and \href{http://www.itesla-project.eu/}{\underline{iTesla}}. These projects have contributed to the choices that are the basis upon which \Dynawo is built: they proved the usability of the Modelica language for power system simulations and contributed to the development of numerical resolution strategies that are integrated into \Dynawo. \\

\textbf{\Dynawo 's primary focus has been on long-term and short-term stability studies} but the very encouraging results obtained and the flexibility of the approach led to \textbf{an extension of the initiative. \Dynawo is now evolving towards a complete and coherent suite of simulation tools}, sharing the same philosophy:
\begin{itemize}
\item DynaFlow for steady-state calculations
\item DySym for short-circuit calculations
\item DynaWaltz for long-term stability simulations
\item DynaSwing for short-term stability studies
\item DynaWave for stability studies and system design with a high-penetration of power-electronics based components (quasi-EMT)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Only validated models, numerical methods and test cases are included into this release.} We plan to release additional features in the near future, including for example additional models (standard wind and solar power plant models, new regulations for synchronous machines, etc.), or new test cases (Nordic32 test case, large-scale test cases).

In addition to the \Dynawo repository, you can have a look to our new dynawo-algorithms repository - \url{https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo-algorithms} -, enabling to launch contingency analysis, voltage margin  or critical clearing time calculations. \\

\section{Getting started}

To get started with \Dynawo , different possibilities exist, depending on your background and what you want to do:
\begin{itemize}
\item If you are interested in the models available and want to have a look to them, please open the \Dynawo Modelica library into OpenModelica and run the full Modelica examples provided with the library.
\item If you want to launch simulations and examples with \Dynawo and observe the performances, you can use the pre-built distribution and run the simulations provided into the examples directory.
\item If you want to modify the tool yourself or try new methods and models, please checkout the repository and build it.
\end{itemize}
