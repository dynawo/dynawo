\chapter{Introduction}

\textbf{\Dynawo is an hybrid C++/Modelica open source time domain simulation tool for power systems. It aims at providing power system stakeholders with a transparent, flexible, interoperable and robust simulation tool that could ease collaboration and cooperation in the power system community.} \\

To achieve this goal, \textbf{\Dynawo is based on two mains principles}: the use of a high-level modelling language \href{https://modelica.org/} {\underline{Modelica}} and a strict separation between the modelling and the solving parts. \\

It is an ongoing project based on previous works conducted particularly in two R\&D European projects: \href{http://www.fp7-pegase.com/}{\underline{Pegase}} and \href{http://www.itesla-project.eu/}{\underline{iTesla}}. These projects have contributed to the choices that are the basis upon which \Dynawo is built: they proved the usability of the Modelica language for power system simulations and contributed to the development of numerical resolution strategies that are integrated into \Dynawo. \\

\textbf{\Dynawo 's primary focus has been on RMS simulations} and most of the
tests done until now have been for long-term and short-term stability studies.
However, the simulation tool structure offers great flexibility and makes it
also possible to run others types of power system simulations, as long as the
user provides the necessary models and solvers. Different initiatives are under discussion or submission to test the possibility to use \Dynawo for EMT simulations or multi-system simulations. \\

\textbf{Only validated models are included into the library that is still under
construction.} We plan to release a new set of models in the near future, e.g.
HVDC, wind and solar power plants models or more different standard regulation
models. \\
