## About Dyna&omega;o

**Dyna&omega;o is an open source time domain simulation tool for power systems using the Modelica language. It aims at providing power system stakeholders with a transparent, flexible, interoperable and robust simulation tool that could ease collaboration and cooperation in the power system community**.

The nature of power system dynamics is deeply evolving towards a more diverse and difficult to predict behavior due to the massive changes going on in the power system (large penetration of power-electronic based components such as Renewable Energies Sources - RES - or High Voltage Direct Current - HVDC - lines, booming use of complex automata, control strategies or smart grids). Due to this radical change from physically-driven to numerically-driven dynamics, being able to assess the system stability becomes harder but is still essential as any generalized incident will be unacceptable for the economy and the consumers. This requires to have access to a transparent, flexible, robust and easy to use simulation tool that will allow to run collaborative studies in a very simple way by sharing not only the same data but also the same modeling and solving choices in an open-source frame. Such tools will ensure to get similar results and to agree upon optimal and shared actions on the system to accompany the ongoing changes in the best possible way. This analysis has motivated us to launch a new effort on time-domain simulation tools that finally ends up in the development of the Dyna&omega;o's software.

**To achieve this goal, Dyna&omega;o is based on two mains principles: the use of a high-level modeling language Modelica and a strict separation between modeling and solving parts**. Modelica is an equation-based, declarative and object-oriented modeling language that is easy to read and understand (the equations are written in a similar way than they are written in textbooks for example) and already used in different and various industrial sectors. Using this language enables to easily share and discuss the modeling choices done because the final models implementation is available in an understandable way, even for the end-user. It is important to mention that Modelica-based tools already exist (Dymola, OpenModelica, JModelica, etc.) but they are not efficient enough for large-scale simulation of power system, which was one of the motivation for Dyna&omega;o. In addition to this, the Modelica language itself has some limitations that are adressed in Dyna&omega;o by the possibility to use C++ models in a similar way than Modelica models. The second important point in Dyna&omega;o is the strict separation between modeler and solvers - it means that the models only expose a few methods to the solvers such as the residual evaluation, the Jacobian evaluation or the zero-crossing functions or in other words that the numerical resolution method doesn't interfere in the modeling part. This feature has several advantages: it enables to easily test or use new solvers, it eases the addition of new model and it allows modeling expert not to bother about numerical difficulties and vice versa.

**Dyna&omega;o's primary focus has been on RMS simulations and most of the tests done until now have been for long-term and short-term stability studies.** However, the simulation tool structure offers great flexibility and makes it also possible to run other types of power system simulations, as long as the user provides the necessary models and solvers. Different initiatives are under discussion or submission to test the possibility to use Dyna&omega;o for EMT simulations or multi-system simulations.

**All validated models are included into the [Dyna&omega;o Modelica library](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo/tree/master/dynawo/sources/Models/Modelica/Dynawo). Don't hesitate to open it in any Modelica environment to see what are the available models.**

<a name="start"></a>
## Getting started!

To get started with Dyna&omega;o you have different possibilities, depending on your background and what you want to do:
- If you are interested in the models available and want to have a quick look to them, please open the [Dyna&omega;o Modelica library](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo/tree/master/dynawo/sources/Models/Modelica/Dynawo) in OpenModelica for example.
- If you want to launch simulations and examples with Dyna&omega;o and observe the performances, you can use the [pre-built distribution](#distribution)
- If you want to checkout the repository and build it yourself to be able to modify the tool, please follow the build instructions available [here](#build)

<a name="distribution"></a>
## Dyna&omega;o Distribution

You can download a pre-built Dyna&omega;o release to start testing it. Pre-built releases are available for **Linux**, **MacOS** and **Windows**:
- [Linux](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo/releases/download/v1.2.0/Dynawo_Linux_v1.2.0.zip)
- [MacOS](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo/releases/download/v1.2.0/Dynawo_MacOS_v1.2.0.zip)
- [Windows](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo/releases/download/v1.2.0/Dynawo_Windows_v1.2.0.zip)

### Linux Requirements for Distribution

- Compilers: C and C++ ([gcc](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/) or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)), C++98 or C++11 compatible for C++ standard
- Python2 or Python3
- Binary utilities: [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) and unzip
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

**Note** For Python you need to have the `python` command available in your PATH. If you don't have one, you can use an environment variable to point to your Python version with `export DYNAWO_PYTHON_COMMAND="python3"`.

You can install the dependencies for Ubuntu or Fedora with:

``` bash
$> apt install -y g++ unzip curl python
$> dnf install -y gcc-c++ unzip curl python
```

### MacOS Requirements for Distribution

- Command Line Tools (with `xcode-select --install`)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

### Windows Requirements for Distribution

On Windows you can either run Dyna&omega;o with distribution models and in this case nothing is required. If you want to be able to add new models you will need:

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Python2](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.18/python-2.7.18.amd64.msi) or [Python3](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2-amd64.exe)

**Note** For Python you need to have the `python` command available in your PATH. If you don't have one you can use an environment variable to point to your Python version with `set DYNAWO_PYTHON_COMMAND=python3`.

### Using a distribution

#### Linux and MacOS

You can launch the following commands to download and test the latest distribution:

``` bash
$> curl -L $(curl -s -L -X GET https://api.github.com/repos/dynawo/dynawo/releases/latest | grep "Dynawo_Linux" | grep url | cut -d '"' -f 4) -o Dynawo_Linux_latest.zip
$> unzip Dynawo_Linux_latest.zip -d Dynawo_Linux_latest
$> Dynawo_Linux_latest/bin/execDynawo.sh jobs-with-curves Dynawo_Linux_latest/testcases/IEEE14/IEEE14_SyntaxExamples/IEEE14_ModelicaModel/IEEE14.jobs
$> Dynawo_Linux_latest/bin/execDynawo.sh help
$> Dynawo_Linux_latest/bin/execDynawo.sh jobs --help
```

#### Windows

Download the zip of the distribution and unzip it somewhere. Then open either `Command Prompt` or `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019` (to be able to use your own models) and use `cd` to go into the directory you previously unzipped. You should see a `dynawo.cmd` file at the top of the folder. You can then launch a simulation with:

``` batch
> dynawo --jobs-file testcases\IEEE14\IEEE14_BasicTestCases\IEEE14_LoadVariation\IEEE14.jobs
```

<a name="requirements"></a>
## Building requirements

You can also build Dyna&omega;o from sources. Dyna&omega;o is a cross-platform software and has been tested on **Linux** platforms (Centos and Debian based), for other distributions don't hesitate to contact us if you run in problems. It has also been tested on **MacOS** (only on Mojave), a complete procedure to help non-developers install it on this platform will be available soon. We recently added **Windows** compatibility and you can now completly build and develop Dynawo on it. <br>
If you have any issue building Dyna&omega;o don't hesitate to send us an [email](mailto:rte-dynawo@rte-france.com) with your errors and we will try to answer you back quickly.

## Building Dyna&omega;o

<a name="build_linux"></a>
### Linux

You can install the following packages to have no dependency problem in the following steps. This example works for Ubuntu:

``` bash
$> apt-get install -y git gcc g++ gfortran autoconf pkgconf automake make libtool cmake hwloc openjdk-8-jdk libblas-dev liblpsolve55-dev libarchive-dev doxygen doxygen-latex liblapack-dev libexpat1-dev libsqlite3-dev zlib1g-dev gettext patch clang python-pip libncurses5-dev libreadline-dev libdigest-perl-md5-perl unzip gcovr lcov libboost-all-dev qt4-qmake qt4-dev-tools lsb-release libxml2-utils python-lxml python-psutil wget libcurl4-openssl-dev rsync bash-completion
```

This one works for Fedora:
``` bash
$> dnf install -y git gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran autoconf automake make libtool cmake hwloc java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel blas-devel lapack-devel lpsolve-devel expat-devel glibc-devel sqlite-devel libarchive-devel zlib-devel doxygen doxygen-latex qt-devel gettext patch wget python-devel clang llvm-devel ncurses-devel readline-devel unzip perl-Digest-MD5 vim gcovr python-pip python-psutil boost-devel lcov gtest-devel gmock-devel xz rsync python-lxml graphviz libcurl-devel bash-completion
```

To build Dyna&omega;o you need to clone this repository and launch the following commands in the source code directory, it will create a `myEnvDynawo.sh` file that will be your personal entrypoint to launch Dyna&omega;o and parametrise some options.

``` bash
$> git clone https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo.git dynawo
$> cd dynawo
$> echo '#!/bin/bash
export DYNAWO_HOME=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)

export DYNAWO_SRC_OPENMODELICA=$DYNAWO_HOME/OpenModelica/Source
export DYNAWO_INSTALL_OPENMODELICA=$DYNAWO_HOME/OpenModelica/Install

export DYNAWO_LOCALE=en_GB
export DYNAWO_RESULTS_SHOW=true
export DYNAWO_BROWSER=firefox

export DYNAWO_NB_PROCESSORS_USED=1

export DYNAWO_BUILD_TYPE=Release
export DYNAWO_CXX11_ENABLED=YES

$DYNAWO_HOME/util/envDynawo.sh $@' > myEnvDynawo.sh
$> chmod +x myEnvDynawo.sh
$> ./myEnvDynawo.sh build-user
```

Below is a description of some environment variables that might be changed in `myEnvDynawo.sh`:

| Variable | Description |
|:----|:----|
| DYNAWO_BROWSER | Default browser command |
| DYNAWO_NB_PROCESSORS_USED | Maximum number of cores to use |
| DYNAWO_BUILD_TYPE | Build type: Release or Debug |

You can have more information about compilation options [here](https://dynawo.github.io/install/compilation_options).

**Warning**: If you're working behind a proxy make sure you have exported the following proxy environment variables
``` bash
$> export http_proxy=http://login:mdp@proxy_address:proxy_port/
$> export https_proxy=https://login:mdp@proxy_address:proxy_port/
$> export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,::1
$> export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy;export HTTPS_PROXY=$https_proxy;export NO_PROXY=$no_proxy;
```

<a name="build_windows"></a>
### Windows

Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019` and run the following commands:

``` batch
> git config --global core.eol lf
> git config --global core.autocrlf input
> set OPENMODELICAHOME=
> set OPENMODELICALIBRARY=
> md dynawo-project && cd dynawo-project
> git clone https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo.git dynawo
> cd dynawo
> cmake -S dynawo/3rdParty -B b-3-p -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../d-3-p -DOPENMODELICA_INSTALL=../OpenModelica/Install -DOPENMODELICA_SRC=../OpenModelica/Source -DOMDEV_HOME=../OMDev -G "NMake Makefiles"
> cmake --build b-3-p
> cmake -S dynawo -B b -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../d-i -DDYNAWO_HOME=.. -DINSTALL_OPENMODELICA=../../OpenModelica/Install -DDYNAWO_THIRD_PARTY_DIR=../../d-3-p -G "NMake Makefiles
> cmake --build b --target install
> cmake --build b --target models
> cmake --build b --target solvers
```

**Warning** We try to limit as far as possible the name of the build and install folders (for example d-i instead of dynawo-install or b-3-p for build-3rd-parties) because of Windows limitation of length of path for folders. We know it causes problems and the only solution is to install Dyna&omega;o in a shorter length directory path.

**Warning** Only the build directories (b and b-3-p) can be located in the `dynawo` folder, the install (d-i and d-3-p), OMDev and OpenModelica folders should be located outside to avoid problems with CMake.

<a name="build_macos"></a>
### MacOS

The difficult part of building Dyna&omega;o on MacOS is the compilation of OpenModelica. We propose two solutions, one with pre-built binaries for OpenModelica and one with building OpenModelica.

#### With pre-built OpenModelica

Use the following commands in a terminal to download those binaries and use them to build Dyna&omega;o:

``` bash
$> curl -L $(curl -s -L -X GET https://api.github.com/repos/dynawo/dynawo/releases/latest | grep "Dynawo_MacOS" | grep url | cut -d '"' -f 4) -o $HOME/Dynawo_MacOS_latest.zip
$> unzip $HOME/Dynawo_MacOS_latest.zip -d $HOME/Dynawo_MacOS_latest
$> git clone https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo.git dynawo
$> cd dynawo
$> mkdir OpenModelica
$> mv $HOME/Dynawo_MacOS_latest/OpenModelica OpenModelica/Install
$> rm -rf $HOME/Dynawo_MacOS_latest*
$> echo '#!/bin/bash
export DYNAWO_HOME=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)

export DYNAWO_SRC_OPENMODELICA=$DYNAWO_HOME/OpenModelica/Source
export DYNAWO_INSTALL_OPENMODELICA=$DYNAWO_HOME/OpenModelica/Install

export DYNAWO_LOCALE=en_GB
export DYNAWO_RESULTS_SHOW=true
export DYNAWO_BROWSER="open -a Safari"
export DYNAWO_NB_PROCESSORS_USED=1

export DYNAWO_BUILD_TYPE=Release
export DYNAWO_CXX11_ENABLED=YES
export DYNAWO_COMPILER=CLANG

export PATH="$(dirname $(xcrun -f llvm-cov))":$PATH

$DYNAWO_HOME/util/envDynawo.sh $@' > myEnvDynawo.sh
$> chmod +x myEnvDynawo.sh
$> ./myEnvDynawo.sh build-user
```

#### With building OpenModelica

A solution has been develop but it is not yet available on Github and we advise you to [contact us](mailto:rte-dynawo@rte-france.com) so we can provide you with it. This solution should be available soon once it is completely stable.

<a name="launch"></a>
## Launch Dyna&omega;o

<a name="launch_linux"></a>
### Linux and MacOS

Once you have build Dyna&omega;o you can start launching a simulation with the command:
``` bash
$> ./myEnvDynawo.sh jobs-with-curves nrt/data/IEEE14/IEEE14_BasicTestCases/IEEE14_DisconnectLine/IEEE14.jobs
```

You can also list all available commands with:
``` bash
$> ./myEnvDynawo.sh help
```

**We advise you to deploy our autocompletion** script to help you with the available commands, it will also set an alias (`dynawo`) in your bashrc or zshrc to be able to call Dyna&omega;o from anywhere. You can launch one of the two following commands:
``` bash
$> ./myEnvDynawo.sh deploy-autocompletion --deploy --shell-type bash
$> ./myEnvDynawo.sh deploy-autocompletion --deploy --shell-type zsh
```

Then you can launch:
``` bash
$> dynawo help
$> dynawo jobs-with-curves nrt/data/IEEE14/IEEE14_BasicTestCases/IEEE14_DisconnectLine/IEEE14.jobs
```

<a name="launch_windows"></a>
